In this project, I will be doing a brief exploration of the CalEnviroScreen dataset and then implementing various ensemble methods using scikit-learn.

I first clean the data and compare different communities. Then I try using a single decision tree to make a prediction on which score bracket a certain tract lies in - i.e. the response variable is CES 3.0 Percentile Range, and saw it wasn't the best performing method. I then moved on to ensemble methods such as random forests and bagging because they use multiple trees and typically perform better than single decision trees. By the end I examined and compared how different ensemble methods would perform on the data.
